## Welcome to the repo for oxyos.org, the website for Oxy Open Source!

#### Components you will need to download/install 

1. Download Node from nodejs.org, and install
2. In the terminal, run the following command:

`sudo npm install -g`

3. Install nodemon:

`sudo npm install -g nodemon`

4. All of the other dependencies are listed in `package.json`. All you need to do is, after cloning the repo to your machine, navigate to the project root and run:

`npm install`


#### Run locally
Run each of these commands in **separate** terminal windows:

`npm run react-dev`

`npm run server-dev`

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. Hopefully this worked! If not, Google and other project members are your friends.
